Red is the color of love, is the color of 
blood, is the color of anger, hate
Red is the color of love, is the color of 
blood, is the color of life and fate

Everyone wants to know the truth
Red is the color of life and youth
Nobody wants to see the signs
Red is voodoo witch designs

What do you do when your world is red?
Take a big knife and stab them dead
What do you do when your world is red?
Put a big shotgun to your head

Red is the sap that oozes from a branch
Red is the warning of an avalanche
Red is the siren on a cop car
Red is the bathroom in a seedy bar

Fun house, gun mouth, no time to get out
Sunset, blood let, no time to get out
Sunrise, dead eyes, no time to get out
Red moon, your doom, no time to get out

Red is the blood that escaped from your mother
Red is the ninja deep undercover
Red is the rose with thorns so sharp
Red is the harvest moon in the dark



Green is the grass, green is the leaf
Green is the color of rest and relief
Green is a big bug chillin' on the heath
Green is the fish in a coral reef

What do you do when your world is green?
Chill out, calm down, rest in between
What do you do when your world is green?
Everything is calm, restful and serene

Everybody wants to take a break
Green like leaves in the tines of a rake
What is hiding in the depths of green?
Way too much if you know what I mean

Green is a worm in a tequila bottle
Green is the color that a tree is mottled
Green is a bike and green is a lichen
Green is a monster, don't be frightened

Low light, twilight, cool your jets hot-shot
Subdued, your mood, cool your jets hot-shot
Green tea, you and me, cool your jets hot-shot
Green bugs, green drugs, cool your jets hot-shot

Green is the gas that escapes from a sewer
Green is the grass underneath the manure
Green is a channel in a video game
Green is your envy, no one to blame
