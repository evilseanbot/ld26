TO DO FOR GAME (By Monday, 6pm):
=======================================
- Optimize Performance.
- Program opening screen
- Incorperate Animations.
- Add sub Shark
- Fix skeleton

- There seems to be a period when starting a new level that things are slow. Put down some kind of interstitial screen before that.

- System for limiting what kind of lights/Modes you can use? (Probably just for first level)
- Design More levels
