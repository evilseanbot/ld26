TO DO FOR GAME (By Monday, 6pm):
=======================================
- Get Music (Henry?)
- Optimize Performance.
- Sound effects: Torches lit, torches extinguished, critters rescued, critters die. (Henry? Chris?)
- Program opening screen
- Incorperate Animations.
- Add sub Shark
- Fix skeleton

- There seems to be a period when starting a new level that things are slow. Put down some kind of interstitial screen before that.


- System for limiting what kind of lights/Modes you can use? (Probably just for first level)
- Design More levels
