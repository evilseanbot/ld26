LEVEL DESIGN BIBLE:
1. Levels should be non-abstract, they should seem like the architecture of a place that could exist.
  - Don't have block suspended in midair unless they seem like an object that could be suspended in midair.
  - Have the different tiles be things that could exist together (Steel blocks on grass seems odd.)

2. They should run well.
  - RIGHT NOW this has been an issue of light sources X lightable blocks for every color.
  - This could change when the engine is changed.
  - Test it on my laptop to make sure.
  
3. They should test an understanding of the concepts more than reflexes. (Atleast to get a small number of critters rescued.)
