Rooster Walk:
-Roosters will emerge from a start point (dropping when they reach the end of a platform, turning if they reach a wall).
-Roosters will stop and crow if the color conditions cause the sun to be newly visible. Then they will continue moving.
-Some platforms have wolves hiding in bushes. If a rooster crows when in range, a wolf will come out and eat it.
-Some platforms and wall don't exist under some color conditions; some platforms move (requiring roosters to crow while it gets back into position).
-The object is to get the roosters to the exit barn.

Dude Barf:
-The dude barfer will only barf dudes under some color conditions.
-The barfed dudes will drop straight down.
-Dudes that touch the moving platforms get squished.
-The object is to get dudes to reach the bottom of the screen.

Spooky chase:
-The scary furry-face man chases the player.
-The sffm occasionally charges.
-The sffm is only visible under some color conditions.
-The object is to get the sffm to charge into the trap without letting him catch the player.

Skeleton Peril:
-Skeletons emerge from a starting point (dropping when they reach the end of a platform, turning if they reach a wall).
-Under some color conditions, only the feet of a skeleton is visible.
-If the skeleton is fully visible when it encounters a swinging pendulum, the skeleton is scattered.
-If a skeleton is fully visible when it encounters a short step it will walk over the short step. Otherwise it turns around.
-The object is to get skeletons to reach the exit mausoleum unscattered.
